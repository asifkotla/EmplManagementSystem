### **Slide 6: Key Components**  

#### **Model Example:**  
```csharp
public class Employee
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public DateTime JoiningDate { get; set; }
    public string Department { get; set; }
    public decimal Salary { get; set; }
}
```

#### **Search Functionality:**  
```csharp
public IEnumerable<Employee> SearchEmployees(string searchType, string searchValue)
{
    switch (searchType.ToLower())
    {
        case "id":
            int id = int.Parse(searchValue);
            return dbo.Employees.Where(e => e.Id == id);
        case "name":
            return dbo.Employees.Where(e => e.Name.Contains(searchValue));
        case "joiningdate":
            DateTime date = DateTime.Parse(searchValue);
            return dbo.Employees.Where(e => e.JoiningDate == date);
        default:
            return Enumerable.Empty<Employee>();
    }
}
```

#### **Email Service:**  
```csharp
public void SendEmail(SendMail sendMail)
{
    MailMessage message = new MailMessage
    {
        From = new MailAddress("employeeemanagementsystem@gmail.com"),
        Subject = sendMail.Subject,
        Body = sendMail.Body,
        IsBodyHtml = true
    };
    message.To.Add(new MailAddress(sendMail.ToEmail));

    var smtpClient = new SmtpClient("smtp.gmail.com")
    {
        Port = 587,
        Credentials = new NetworkCredential("employeeemanagementsystem@gmail.com", "password"),
        EnableSsl = true
    };
    smtpClient.Send(message);
}
```

#### **Database Schema:**  
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    Id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    Name NVARCHAR(100),
    JoiningDate DATE,
    Department NVARCHAR(50),
    Salary DECIMAL(18, 2)
);
```
