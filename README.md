## Key Components

### **Model Example**
```csharp
public class Employee
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public DateTime JoiningDate { get; set; }
    public string Department { get; set; }
    public decimal Salary { get; set; }
}
```

### **Search Functionality**
```csharp
public IEnumerable<Employee> SearchEmployees(string searchType, string searchValue)
{
    switch (searchType.ToLower())
    {
        case "id":
            int id = int.Parse(searchValue);
            return dbo.Employees.Where(e => e.Id == id);
        case "name":
            return dbo.Employees.Where(e => e.Name.Contains(searchValue));
        case "joiningdate":
            DateTime date = DateTime.Parse(searchValue);
            return dbo.Employees.Where(e => e.JoiningDate == date);
        default:
            return Enumerable.Empty<Employee>();
    }
}
```

### **Email Service**
```csharp
public void SendEmail(SendMail sendMail)
{
    MailMessage message = new MailMessage
    {
        From = new MailAddress("employeeemanagementsystem@gmail.com"),
        Subject = sendMail.Subject,
        Body = sendMail.Body,
        IsBodyHtml = true
    };
    message.To.Add(new MailAddress(sendMail.ToEmail));

    var smtpClient = new SmtpClient("smtp.gmail.com")
    {
        Port = 587,
        Credentials = new NetworkCredential("employeeemanagementsystem@gmail.com", "password"),
        EnableSsl = true
    };
    smtpClient.Send(message);
}
```

### **Database Schema**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    Id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    Name NVARCHAR(100),
    JoiningDate DATE,
    Department NVARCHAR(50),
    Salary DECIMAL(18, 2)
);
```

**Note:**  
To enable the SMTP email functionality in this project, you need to replace the placeholders in the following lines of code with your own email address and app password:  

```csharp
string fromemail = "Your Email";  
string frompass = "Your App Password";  
```

### Steps:
1. **Email Address**: Use the email address you want to send emails from. Ensure this account is configured to allow SMTP access.  
2. **App Password**: Generate an app password for your email account instead of using your main password.  
   - For Gmail: Go to your Google Account > Security > App Passwords, and create an app password.  
   - For other providers: Check their documentation on enabling SMTP and generating app passwords.  

> **Caution:** Never hard-code sensitive credentials in production. Use environment variables or secure storage for better security.
